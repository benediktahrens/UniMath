Ktheory
=======

This package aims to formalize theorems of higher algebraic K-theory.

We start by introducing the category theory needed for K-theory:

  - products, coproducts, direct sums, finite direct sums
  - additive categories, matrices
  - exact categories

  We are working toward definitions of "additive category" and "abelian
  category" as properties of a category, rather than as an added structure.
  That is the approach of Mac Lane in sections 18, 19, and 21 of :
